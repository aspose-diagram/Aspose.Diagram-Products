 .NET developers can easily load & convert VSTX files to VSX in just a few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

1.  Load VSTX file with an instance of Diagram class
1.  Call the Diagram.Save method with output file path and SaveFileFormat.VSX as parameters
1.  VSX file will be saved at the specified path

 A Diagram Management Library specially designed to work with Microsoft Visio files. It allows developers to create, manipulate & convert native Visio formats. Developers can create diagrams from scratch as well as easily load existing files and manipulate the elements of the diagram to export the result in other formats.

Files with VSTX extensions are drawing template files created with Microsoft Visio 2013 and above. These VSTX files provide starting point for creating Visio drawings, saved as .VSDX files, with default layout and settings. In general, Visio files are used to create drawings that contain visual objects, flow charts, UML diagram, information flow, organizational charts, software diagrams, network layout, database models, objects mapping and other similar information. Files generated using Visio can also be exported to different file formats such as PNG, BMP, PDF and others. Programs that open VSTX files include Microsoft Visio for Windows and Mac that let you open these files for viewing and editing. It also allows to convert Visio file formats to a number of other formats.

Files with .VSX extension refer to stencils that consist of drawings and shapes that are used for creating diagrams in Microsoft Visio. VSX files are saved in XML file format and was supported till Visio 2013. These are different than the primary VSDX file format that was introduced with Microsoft Visio 2013. VSX files can be opened in any text editor to view the contents.
