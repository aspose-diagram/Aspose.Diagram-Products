Any drawing or chart created in Microsoft Visio, but saved in XML format have .VDX extension. A Visio drawing XML file is created in Visio software, which is developed by Microsoft. Microsoft Visio has the capability to generate visual documents that can be used in presentations and documents. The Visio drawing XML file contains the visual objects and metadata details of the visual elements. Text can also be added to these visual elements Vision drawing XML file. These Visio drawing XML files are integrated with XML-based formatting standards and image data encoding specifications that allow its content to be rendered and stored by the Microsoft Visio software in the VDX file format.

Files with .VSSM extension are Microsoft Visio Stencil files that support provide support for macros. A VSSM file when opened allows to run the macros to achieve desired formatting and placement of shapes in a diagram. In general, Microsoft Visio is drawing software that allows to create files that can contain and represent user defined information in different shapes. The most common of these include, but not limited to, UML diagrams, flow charts, visual objects, information flow, organizational charts, software diagrams, network layout, database models, objects mapping and other similar information. Files generated using Visio can also be converted to different file formats such as PNG, BMP, PDF and others.
