A basic conversion with Aspose APIs can be done with just 2 lines of code. Our APIs are supported on all major platforms and Operating Systems. Before executing the code below, please make sure that you have the following prerequisites on your system. First you need Microsoft Windows or a compatible OS with .NET Framework and .NET Core, Windows Azure, Mono or Xamarin Platforms, Development environment like Microsoft Visual Studio and Aspose.Words for .NET DLL referenced in your project.

    {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="EMF" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/image/emf/" >}}
Enhanced metafile format (EMF) stores graphical images device-independently. Metafiles of EMF comprises of variable-length records in chronological order that can render the stored image after parsing on any output device. These variable-length records can be definitions of enclosed objects, commands for drawing, and graphics properties critical to render the image accurately. When a device opens an EMF metafile using its own graphics environment, the proportions, dimensions, colors and other graphic properties of original image remains same regardless of the opening device platform.
