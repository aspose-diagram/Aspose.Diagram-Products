 Aspose.Diagram makes it easy for the developers to load & convert VDW files to VSDM in just a few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

1.  Load VDW file with an instance of Diagram class
1.  Call the Diagram.Save method with output file path and SaveFileFormat.VSDM as parameters
1.  VSDM file will be saved at the specified path

 A Diagram Management Library specially designed to work with Microsoft Visio files. It allows developers to create, manipulate & convert native Visio formats. Developers can create diagrams from scratch as well as easily load existing files and manipulate the elements of the diagram to export the result in other formats.

        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="VDW" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/web/vdw/" >}}
VDW is the Visio Graphics Service file format that specifies the streams and storages required for rendering a Web drawing. A web drawing is a collection of drawing pages, shapes, fonts, images, data connections, and diagram update information that can be rendered as a vector or raster drawing. VDW files can be opened in Microsoft Visio as well but are primarily saved for use on web. Microsoft Visio offers the capability to convert Visio files to a number of different file formats including PNG, BMP, PDF and others.

        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="vsdm" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/image/vsdm/" >}}
Files with VSDM extension are drawing files created with Microsoft Visio application that supports macros. VSDM files are OPC/XML drawings that are similar to VSDX but also provide the capability to run macros when the file is opened. Macros are user defined actions/steps that are developed in Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) and can be used to perform repeatitive tasks. VSDM file format was introduced with the launch of Microsoft Visio 2013.  Visio files are used to create drawings that contain visual objects, flow charts, UML diagram, information flow, organizational charts, software diagrams, network layout, database models, objects mapping and other similar information. Files generated using Visio can also be exported to different file formats such as PNG, BMP, PDF and others.
