 Aspose.Diagram is a Microsoft Visio document format manipulation API. One can easily load, create, modify, manipulate including daigram elements and convert Visio diagrams to other formats such as PDF, XPS, JPEG, PNG, BMP, TIFF, SVG, EMF and more. It is a standalone API and does not require Microsoft Visio or any other software to be installed. вЂЋ

+  Load all the VSDM files with full path.
+  Make one document as the base file
+  Call the relevant method for concatenating and merging files one by one.
+  Call the Save() method and pass the file name (full path) and format (VSDM) as a parameter.
+  Now you can open and use the VSDM file in Microsoft Office, Adobe PDF or any other compatible program.

Files with VSDM extension are drawing files created with Microsoft Visio application that supports macros. VSDM files are OPC/XML drawings that are similar to VSDX but also provide the capability to run macros when the file is opened. Macros are user defined actions/steps that are developed in Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) and can be used to perform repeatitive tasks. VSDM file format was introduced with the launch of Microsoft Visio 2013.  Visio files are used to create drawings that contain visual objects, flow charts, UML diagram, information flow, organizational charts, software diagrams, network layout, database models, objects mapping and other similar information. Files generated using Visio can also be exported to different file formats such as PNG, BMP, PDF and others. Read More
