 In order to merge VSSM file, we’ll use
 [Aspose.Diagram for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/diagram/net) 
 API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use document manipulation and merging API for C# platform. Open
 [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/aspose.diagram) 
 package manager, search for

 A basic document merging and concatenating with
 [Aspose.Diagram for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/diagram/net) 
 APIs can be done with just few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

+  Load all the VSSM files with full path.
+  Make one document as the base file
+  Call the relevant method for concatenating and merging files one by one.
+  Call the Save() method and pass the file name (full path) and format (VSSM) as a parameter.
+  Now you can open and use the VSSM file in Microsoft Office, Adobe PDF or any other compatible program.

    {{% blocks/products/pf/agp/content h2="About Aspose.Diagram for .NET API" %}}

 Aspose.Diagram is a Microsoft Visio document format manipulation API. One can easily load, create, modify, manipulate including daigram elements and convert Visio diagrams to other formats such as PDF, XPS, JPEG, PNG, BMP, TIFF, SVG, EMF and more. It is a standalone API and does not require Microsoft Visio or any other software to be installed. ‎

Files with .VSSM extension are Microsoft Visio Stencil files that support provide support for macros. A VSSM file when opened allows to run the macros to achieve desired formatting and placement of shapes in a diagram. In general, Microsoft Visio is drawing software that allows to create files that can contain and represent user defined information in different shapes. The most common of these include, but not limited to, UML diagrams, flow charts, visual objects, information flow, organizational charts, software diagrams, network layout, database models, objects mapping and other similar information. Files generated using Visio can also be converted to different file formats such as PNG, BMP, PDF and others.
