 Generating VSSM file dynamically within running application is easy. In order to create VSSM documents from scratch without requiring MS Office, weâ€™ll use
 [Aspose.Diagram for Java](https://products.aspose.com/diagram/java) 
 API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use Diagram API for Java platform. You can download its latest version directly from
 [Maven](https://repository.aspose.com/webapp/#/artifacts/browse/tree/General/repo/com/aspose/aspose-diagram) 
 and install it within your Maven-based project by adding the following configurations to the pom.xml.

 It is easy for the developers to create, load, modify and convert VSSM (Portable Document Format) within running different reporting applications for data processing in just a few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

1.  Include the namespace in your class file
1.  Create Diagram class instance.
1.  Access the first page of the diagram.
1.  Add text in the page.
1.  Use save method to save the diagram as VSSM file.

 An Visio Programming Library capable of building cross-platform applications with the ability to generate, modify, convert, render and print VSSM files. .NET Visio API not only convert between spreadsheet formats, it can also render Visio files as images, VSSM, HTML and more, thus making it a perfect choice to exchange documents in industry-standard formats.

Files with .VSSM extension are Microsoft Visio Stencil files that support provide support for macros. A VSSM file when opened allows to run the macros to achieve desired formatting and placement of shapes in a diagram. In general, Microsoft Visio is drawing software that allows to create files that can contain and represent user defined information in different shapes. The most common of these include, but not limited to, UML diagrams, flow charts, visual objects, information flow, organizational charts, software diagrams, network layout, database models, objects mapping and other similar information. Files generated using Visio can also be converted to different file formats such as PNG, BMP, PDF and others.
