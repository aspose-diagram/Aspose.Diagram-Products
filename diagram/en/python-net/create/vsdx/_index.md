 Generating VSDX file dynamically within running application is easy. In order to create VSDX documents from scratch without requiring MS Office, weâ€™ll use
[Aspose.Diagram for Python](https://products.aspose.com/diagram/python-net/) 
 API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use conversion API for Python platform. You can download its latest version directly from
 [Pypi](https://pypi.org/project/aspose-diagram-python/)

1.  Include the namespace in your class file
1.  Create Diagram class instance.
1.  Access the first page of the diagram.
1.  Add text in the page.
1.  Use save method to save the diagram as VSDX file.

 An Visio Programming Library capable of building cross-platform applications with the ability to generate, modify, convert, render and print VSDX files. .NET Visio API not only convert between spreadsheet formats, it can also render Visio files as images, VSDX, VSDX and more, thus making it a perfect choice to exchange documents in industry-standard formats.

Files with .VSDX extension represent Microsoft Visio file format introduced from Microsoft Office 2013 onwards. It was developed to replace the binary file format, .VSD, which is supported by earlier versions of Microsoft Visio. It is also supported on Visio Services in Microsoft SharePoint Server 2013 and does not require an intermediary file format for publishing to SharePoint Server. Visio files are used to create drawings that contain visual objects, flow charts, UML diagram, information flow, organizational charts, software diagrams, network layout, database models, objects mapping and other similar information. Files generated using Visio can also be exported to different file formats such as PNG, BMP, PDF and others.
