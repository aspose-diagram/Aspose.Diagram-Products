[Aspose.Diagram for Python](https://products.aspose.com/diagram/python-net) 
 APIs can be done with just few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

+  Create a diagram from stencil.
+  Select Page via its id
+  Add organization node shapes to page.
+  Add connectors to page to connect shape and its parent.
+  Auto layout by invoking layout mothod
+  Call the save() method and pass the file name (full path) and format (VSDX) as a parameter.
+  Now you can open and use the VSDX file in Microsoft Office, Adobe PDF or any other compatible program.

 Aspose.Diagram is a Microsoft Visio document format manipulation API. One can easily load, create, modify, manipulate including daigram elements and convert Visio diagrams to other formats such as PDF, XPS, JPEG, PNG, BMP, TIFF, SVG, EMF and more. It is a standalone API and does not require Microsoft Visio or any other software to be installed.

VDW is the Visio Graphics Service file format that specifies the streams and storages required for rendering a Web drawing. A web drawing is a collection of drawing pages, shapes, fonts, images, data connections, and diagram update information that can be rendered as a vector or raster drawing. VDW files can be opened in Microsoft Visio as well but are primarily saved for use on web. Microsoft Visio offers the capability to convert Visio files to a number of different file formats including PNG, BMP, PDF and others.
