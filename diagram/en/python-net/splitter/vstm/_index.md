 In order to split VSTM file, weâ€™ll use
 [Aspose.Diagram for Python](https://products.aspose.com/diagram/python-net/) 
 API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use conversion API for Python platform. You can download its latest version directly from
 [Pypi](https://pypi.org/project/aspose-diagram-python/)

 A basic document compressing
 [Aspose.Diagram for Python](https://products.aspose.com/diagram/python-net) 
 APIs can be done with just few lines of code.

+  Load the VSTM file with full path for splitting.
+  Iterate throug each page
+  Create a new Diagram class object
+  Copy the page via [Copy method]
+  Call the save() method and pass the file name (full path) and SaveFileFormat.VSDX as parameter.

    {{% blocks/products/pf/agp/content h2="About Aspose.Diagram for Python via .Net API" %}}

 Aspose.Diagram is a Microsoft Visio document format manipulation API. One can easily load, create, modify, manipulate including daigram elements and convert Visio diagrams to other formats such as PDF, XPS, JPEG, PNG, BMP, TIFF, SVG, EMF and more. It is a standalone API and does not require Microsoft Visio or any other software to be installed.

Files with VSTM extension are template files created with Microsoft Visio that support macros. Unlike VSDX files, files created from VSTM templates can run macros that are developed in Visual Basic for Applications (VBA)  code. A template file can be created in order to provide basic settings of the document that can be utilized to generate further documents with these settings. Visio files are used to create drawings that contain visual objects, flow charts, UML diagram, information flow, organizational charts, software diagrams, network layout, database models, objects mapping and other similar information. Files generated using Visio can also be exported to different file formats such as PNG, BMP, PDF and others.
