 Python developers can easily convert VST file to VSTX in just a few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

1.  Load VST file with an instance of Diagram class
1.  Call Diagram.save method with output file path and SaveFileFormat as parameters
1.  VSTX file will be saved at the specified path

 Aspose.Diagram is a Microsoft Visio document format manipulation API. One can easily load, create, modify, manipulate including daigram elements and convert Visio diagrams to other formats such as PDF, XPS, JPEG, PNG, VSTX, TIFF, SVG, EMF and more. It is a standalone API and does not require Microsoft Visio or any other software to be installed.

Files with VST extension are vector image files created with Microsoft Visio and act as template for creating further files. These template files are in binary file format and contain the default layout and settings that are utilized for creation of new Visio drawings. When a VST file is opened in Microsoft Visio, it contains the existing settings to continue working with the document. In general, Visio files are used to create drawings that contain visual objects, flow charts, UML diagram, information flow, organizational charts, software diagrams, network layout, database models, objects mapping and other similar information. Files generated using Visio can also be exported to different file formats such as PNG, BMP, PDF and others.

Files with VSTX extensions are drawing template files created with Microsoft Visio 2013 and above. These VSTX files provide starting point for creating Visio drawings, saved as .VSDX files, with default layout and settings. In general, Visio files are used to create drawings that contain visual objects, flow charts, UML diagram, information flow, organizational charts, software diagrams, network layout, database models, objects mapping and other similar information. Files generated using Visio can also be exported to different file formats such as PNG, BMP, PDF and others. Programs that open VSTX files include Microsoft Visio for Windows and Mac that let you open these files for viewing and editing. It also allows to convert Visio file formats to a number of other formats.
