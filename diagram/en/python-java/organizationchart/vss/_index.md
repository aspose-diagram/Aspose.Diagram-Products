 Creating CompactTree style organization chart with
[Aspose.Diagram for Python](https://products.aspose.com/diagram/python-java) 
 APIs can be done with just few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

+  Create a diagram from stencil.
+  Select Page via its id
+  Add organization node shapes to page.
+  Add connectors to page to connect shape and its parent.
+  Auto layout by invoking layout mothod
+  Call the save() method and pass the file name (full path) and format (VSDX) as a parameter.
+  Now you can open and use the VSDX file in Microsoft Office, Adobe PDF or any other compatible program.

    {{% blocks/products/pf/agp/content h2="About Aspose.Diagram for Python via java API" %}}

 Aspose.Diagram is a Microsoft Visio document format manipulation API. One can easily load, create, modify, manipulate including daigram elements and convert Visio diagrams to other formats such as PDF, XPS, JPEG, PNG, BMP, TIFF, SVG, EMF and more. It is a standalone API and does not require Microsoft Visio or any other software to be installed.

VSS are stencil files created with Microsoft Visio 2007 and earlier. A relatively new file format is .VSSX that was introduced with Microsoft Visio 2013. Stencil files provide drawing objects that can be included in a .VSD Visio drawing. Microsoft Visio itself is known for creating drawing elements such as collection of shapes, connectors, flowcharts, network layout, UML diagrams, software diagrams, database models, objects mapping and other similar information. It also has rich conversion features of Visio documents to other file formats such as PNG, BMP, PDF and others. Visio is available for both Windows and Mac OS.
