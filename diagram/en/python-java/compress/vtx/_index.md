 In order to compress VTX file, weâ€™ll use
 [Aspose.Diagram for Python](https://products.aspose.com/diagram/python-java/) 
 API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use conversion API for Python platform. You can download its latest version directly from

 A basic document compressing
 [Aspose.Diagram for Python](https://products.aspose.com/diagram/python-java) 
 APIs can be done with just few lines of code.

+  Load Visio file using Diagram class object
+  Use Diagram's removeHiddenInformation function
+  Call the save() method and pass the file name (full path) and format (VSDX) as a parameter.
+  Now you can open and use the VSDX file in Microsoft Office, Adobe PDF or any other compatible program.

 Aspose.Diagram is a Microsoft Visio document format manipulation API. One can easily load, create, modify, manipulate including daigram elements and convert Visio diagrams to other formats such as PDF, XPS, JPEG, PNG, BMP, TIFF, SVG, EMF and more. It is a standalone API and does not require Microsoft Visio or any other software to be installed.

A file with .vtx extension is a Microsoft Visio drawing template that is saved to disc in XML file format. The template is aimed to provide a file with basic settings that can be used to create multiple Visio files of the same settings. Another similar format is VST which is saved in binary format rather than XML. VTX files are supported with Visio 2010 and newer versions. Visio files are used to create drawings that contain visual objects, flow charts, UML diagram, information flow, organizational charts, software diagrams, network layout, database models, objects mapping and other similar information. Files generated using Visio can also be exported to different file formats such as PNG, BMP, PDF and others.
