 Generating VSDM file dynamically within running application is easy. In order to create VSDM documents from scratch without requiring MS Office, weâ€™ll use
[Aspose.Diagram for Python](https://products.aspose.com/diagram/python-java/) 
 API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use conversion API for Python platform. You can download its latest version directly from
 [Pypi](https://pypi.org/project/aspose-diagram/)

 It is easy for the developers to create, load, modify and convert VSDM (Portable Document Format) within running different reporting applications for data processing in just a few lines of code.

1.  Include the namespace in your class file
1.  Create Diagram class instance.
1.  Access the first page of the diagram.
1.  Add text in the page.
1.  Use save method to save the diagram as VSDM file.

jpype.startJVM() 
from asposediagram.api import *
// Create Diagram class instance.
diagram = new Diagram();

// Access the first page of the diagram.
page = diagram.getPages().get(0);

// Add Text shape.
shape = page.addText(1, 1, 1, 1, "Test text", "Calibri", "#a5a5a5", 0.25);

// Save the Diagram as .vsdm file.
diagram.save("out.vsdm",SaveFileFormat.VSDM);

 An Visio Programming Library capable of building cross-platform applications with the ability to generate, modify, convert, render and print VSDM files. .NET Visio API not only convert between spreadsheet formats, it can also render Visio files as images, VSDM, VSDM and more, thus making it a perfect choice to exchange documents in industry-standard formats.

Files with VSDM extension are drawing files created with Microsoft Visio application that supports macros. VSDM files are OPC/XML drawings that are similar to VSDX but also provide the capability to run macros when the file is opened. Macros are user defined actions/steps that are developed in Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) and can be used to perform repeatitive tasks. VSDM file format was introduced with the launch of Microsoft Visio 2013.  Visio files are used to create drawings that contain visual objects, flow charts, UML diagram, information flow, organizational charts, software diagrams, network layout, database models, objects mapping and other similar information. Files generated using Visio can also be exported to different file formats such as PNG, BMP, PDF and others.
