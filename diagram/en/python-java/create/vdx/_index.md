 Generating VDX file dynamically within running application is easy. In order to create VDX documents from scratch without requiring MS Office, weâ€™ll use
[Aspose.Diagram for Python](https://products.aspose.com/diagram/python-java/) 
 API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use conversion API for Python platform. You can download its latest version directly from
 [Pypi](https://pypi.org/project/aspose-diagram/)

1.  Include the namespace in your class file
1.  Create Diagram class instance.
1.  Access the first page of the diagram.
1.  Add text in the page.
1.  Use save method to save the diagram as VDX file.

// Create Diagram class instance.
diagram = new Diagram();

// Access the first page of the diagram.
page = diagram.getPages().get(0);

// Add Text shape.
shape = page.addText(1, 1, 1, 1, "Test text", "Calibri", "#a5a5a5", 0.25);

// Save the Diagram as .vdx file.
diagram.save("out.vdx",SaveFileFormat.VDX);

 An Visio Programming Library capable of building cross-platform applications with the ability to generate, modify, convert, render and print VDX files. .NET Visio API not only convert between spreadsheet formats, it can also render Visio files as images, VDX, VDX and more, thus making it a perfect choice to exchange documents in industry-standard formats.

Any drawing or chart created in Microsoft Visio, but saved in XML format have .VDX extension. A Visio drawing XML file is created in Visio software, which is developed by Microsoft. Microsoft Visio has the capability to generate visual documents that can be used in presentations and documents. The Visio drawing XML file contains the visual objects and metadata details of the visual elements. Text can also be added to these visual elements Vision drawing XML file. These Visio drawing XML files are integrated with XML-based formatting standards and image data encoding specifications that allow its content to be rendered and stored by the Microsoft Visio software in the VDX file format.
