 Generating VSTM file dynamically within running application is easy. In order to create VSTM documents from scratch without requiring MS Office, weâ€™ll use
[Aspose.Diagram for Python](https://products.aspose.com/diagram/python-java/) 
 API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use conversion API for Python platform. You can download its latest version directly from
 [Pypi](https://pypi.org/project/aspose-diagram/)

 It is easy for the developers to create, load, modify and convert VSTM (Portable Document Format) within running different reporting applications for data processing in just a few lines of code.

1.  Include the namespace in your class file
1.  Create Diagram class instance.
1.  Access the first page of the diagram.
1.  Add text in the page.
1.  Use save method to save the diagram as VSTM file.

jpype.startJVM() 
from asposediagram.api import *
// Create Diagram class instance.
diagram = new Diagram();

// Access the first page of the diagram.
page = diagram.getPages().get(0);

// Add Text shape.
shape = page.addText(1, 1, 1, 1, "Test text", "Calibri", "#a5a5a5", 0.25);

// Save the Diagram as .vstm file.
diagram.save("out.vstm",SaveFileFormat.VSTM);

 An Visio Programming Library capable of building cross-platform applications with the ability to generate, modify, convert, render and print VSTM files. .NET Visio API not only convert between spreadsheet formats, it can also render Visio files as images, VSTM, VSTM and more, thus making it a perfect choice to exchange documents in industry-standard formats.

Files with VSTM extension are template files created with Microsoft Visio that support macros. Unlike VSDX files, files created from VSTM templates can run macros that are developed in Visual Basic for Applications (VBA)  code. A template file can be created in order to provide basic settings of the document that can be utilized to generate further documents with these settings. Visio files are used to create drawings that contain visual objects, flow charts, UML diagram, information flow, organizational charts, software diagrams, network layout, database models, objects mapping and other similar information. Files generated using Visio can also be exported to different file formats such as PNG, BMP, PDF and others.
