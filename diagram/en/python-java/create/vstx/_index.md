 Generating VSTX file dynamically within running application is easy. In order to create VSTX documents from scratch without requiring MS Office, weâ€™ll use
[Aspose.Diagram for Python](https://products.aspose.com/diagram/python-java/) 
 API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use conversion API for Python platform. You can download its latest version directly from
 [Pypi](https://pypi.org/project/aspose-diagram/)

1.  Include the namespace in your class file
1.  Create Diagram class instance.
1.  Access the first page of the diagram.
1.  Add text in the page.
1.  Use save method to save the diagram as VSTX file.

from asposediagram.api import *
// Create Diagram class instance.
diagram = new Diagram();

// Access the first page of the diagram.
page = diagram.getPages().get(0);

// Add Text shape.
shape = page.addText(1, 1, 1, 1, "Test text", "Calibri", "#a5a5a5", 0.25);

// Save the Diagram as .vstx file.

 An Visio Programming Library capable of building cross-platform applications with the ability to generate, modify, convert, render and print VSTX files. .NET Visio API not only convert between spreadsheet formats, it can also render Visio files as images, VSTX, VSTX and more, thus making it a perfect choice to exchange documents in industry-standard formats.

Files with VSTX extensions are drawing template files created with Microsoft Visio 2013 and above. These VSTX files provide starting point for creating Visio drawings, saved as .VSDX files, with default layout and settings. In general, Visio files are used to create drawings that contain visual objects, flow charts, UML diagram, information flow, organizational charts, software diagrams, network layout, database models, objects mapping and other similar information. Files generated using Visio can also be exported to different file formats such as PNG, BMP, PDF and others. Programs that open VSTX files include Microsoft Visio for Windows and Mac that let you open these files for viewing and editing. It also allows to convert Visio file formats to a number of other formats.
