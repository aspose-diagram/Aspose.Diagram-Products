 In order to render VST to SWF, weâ€™ll use
 [Aspose.Diagram for Python](https://products.aspose.com/diagram/python-java/) 
 API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use conversion API for Python platform. You can download its latest version directly from
 [Pypi](https://pypi.org/project/aspose-diagram/)

 Python developers can easily convert VST file to SWF in just a few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

1.  Load VST file with an instance of Diagram class
1.  Call Diagram.save method with output file path and SaveFileFormat as parameters
1.  SWF file will be saved at the specified path

 Aspose.Diagram is a Microsoft Visio document format manipulation API. One can easily load, create, modify, manipulate including daigram elements and convert Visio diagrams to other formats such as PDF, XPS, JPEG, PNG, BMP, TIFF, SVG, EMF and more. It is a standalone API and does not require Microsoft Visio or any other software to be installed.

        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="VST" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/visio/vst/" >}}

Files with VST extension are vector image files created with Microsoft Visio and act as template for creating further files. These template files are in binary file format and contain the default layout and settings that are utilized for creation of new Visio drawings. When a VST file is opened in Microsoft Visio, it contains the existing settings to continue working with the document. In general, Visio files are used to create drawings that contain visual objects, flow charts, UML diagram, information flow, organizational charts, software diagrams, network layout, database models, objects mapping and other similar information. Files generated using Visio can also be exported to different file formats such as PNG, BMP, PDF and others.

        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="SWF" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/page-description-language/swf/" >}}

SWF is a file format used to transport text, video, vector graphics and ActionScript over the internet and supported by Adobe Flash Player. The SWF file format is designed to be a resourceful transfer format, not only for exchanging graphics but also provides supports for anti-aliasing and on-screen display. Anti-aliasing is a feature that is critical  for fast rendering of bitmap and its associated characteristics like interactive buttons, shading and animation .etc.
