 In order to render VSDM to HTML, weâ€™ll use
 [Aspose.Diagram for Python](https://products.aspose.com/diagram/python-java/) 
 API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use conversion API for Python platform. You can download its latest version directly from
 [Pypi](https://pypi.org/project/aspose-diagram/)

 Python developers can easily convert VSDM file to HTML in just a few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

1.  Load VSDM file with an instance of Diagram class
1.  Call Diagram.save method with output file path and SaveFileFormat as parameters
1.  HTML file will be saved at the specified path

 Aspose.Diagram is a Microsoft Visio document format manipulation API. One can easily load, create, modify, manipulate including daigram elements and convert Visio diagrams to other formats such as PDF, XPS, JPEG, PNG, BMP, TIFF, SVG, EMF and more. It is a standalone API and does not require Microsoft Visio or any other software to be installed.

Files with VSDM extension are drawing files created with Microsoft Visio application that supports macros. VSDM files are OPC/XML drawings that are similar to VSDX but also provide the capability to run macros when the file is opened. Macros are user defined actions/steps that are developed in Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) and can be used to perform repeatitive tasks. VSDM file format was introduced with the launch of Microsoft Visio 2013.  Visio files are used to create drawings that contain visual objects, flow charts, UML diagram, information flow, organizational charts, software diagrams, network layout, database models, objects mapping and other similar information. Files generated using Visio can also be exported to different file formats such as PNG, BMP, PDF and others.

HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language) is the extension for web pages created for display in browsers. Known as language of the web, HTML has evolved with requirements of new information requirements to be displayed as part of web pages. The latest variant is known as HTML 5 that gives a lot of flexibility for working with the language. HTML pages are either received from server, where these are hosted, or can be loaded from local system as well. Each HTML page is made up of HTML elements such as forms, text, images, animations, links, etc. These elements are represented by tags such as img, a, p and several others where each tag has start and end. It can also embed applications written in scripting languages such as JavaScript and Style Sheets (CSS) for overall layout representation.
