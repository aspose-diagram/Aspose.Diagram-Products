 In order to annotate VST file, weâ€™ll use
 [Aspose.Diagram for Python](https://products.aspose.com/diagram/python-java/) 
 API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use conversion API for Python platform. You can download its latest version directly from
 [Pypi](https://pypi.org/project/aspose-diagram/)

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

 A basic document annotation and concatenating with
 [Aspose.Diagram for Python](https://products.aspose.com/diagram/python-java) 
 APIs can be done with just few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

+  Load VST file by creating an instance of Diagram
+  Select Page via its id
+  Get annotation in Page's Pagesheet
+  Call the remove() method to remove the comment
+  Call the save() method and pass the file name (full path) and format (VSDX) as a parameter.
+  Now you can open and use the VSDX file in Microsoft Office, Adobe PDF or any other compatible program.

    {{% blocks/products/pf/agp/content h2="About Aspose.Diagram for Python via java API" %}}

 Aspose.Diagram is a Microsoft Visio document format manipulation API. One can easily load, create, modify, manipulate including daigram elements and convert Visio diagrams to other formats such as PDF, XPS, JPEG, PNG, BMP, TIFF, SVG, EMF and more. It is a standalone API and does not require Microsoft Visio or any other software to be installed.

        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="VST" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/visio/vst/" >}}
Files with VST extension are vector image files created with Microsoft Visio and act as template for creating further files. These template files are in binary file format and contain the default layout and settings that are utilized for creation of new Visio drawings. When a VST file is opened in Microsoft Visio, it contains the existing settings to continue working with the document. In general, Visio files are used to create drawings that contain visual objects, flow charts, UML diagram, information flow, organizational charts, software diagrams, network layout, database models, objects mapping and other similar information. Files generated using Visio can also be exported to different file formats such as PNG, BMP, PDF and others.
