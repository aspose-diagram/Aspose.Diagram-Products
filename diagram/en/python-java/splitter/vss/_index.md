 In order to split VSS file, weâ€™ll use
 [Aspose.Diagram for Python](https://products.aspose.com/diagram/python-java/) 
 API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use conversion API for Python platform. You can download its latest version directly from
 [Pypi](https://pypi.org/project/aspose-diagram/)

 A basic document compressing
 [Aspose.Diagram for Python](https://products.aspose.com/diagram/python-java) 
 APIs can be done with just few lines of code.

+  Load the VSS file with full path for splitting.
+  Iterate throug each page
+  Create a new Diagram class object
+  Copy the page via [Copy method](https://reference.aspose.com/diagram/python-java/asposediagram.api/page#copy(com.aspose.diagram.Page)))
+  Call the save() method and pass the file name (full path) and SaveFileFormat.VSDX as parameter.

 Aspose.Diagram is a Microsoft Visio document format manipulation API. One can easily load, create, modify, manipulate including daigram elements and convert Visio diagrams to other formats such as PDF, XPS, JPEG, PNG, BMP, TIFF, SVG, EMF and more. It is a standalone API and does not require Microsoft Visio or any other software to be installed.

VSS are stencil files created with Microsoft Visio 2007 and earlier. A relatively new file format is .VSSX that was introduced with Microsoft Visio 2013. Stencil files provide drawing objects that can be included in a .VSD Visio drawing. Microsoft Visio itself is known for creating drawing elements such as collection of shapes, connectors, flowcharts, network layout, UML diagrams, software diagrams, database models, objects mapping and other similar information. It also has rich conversion features of Visio documents to other file formats such as PNG, BMP, PDF and others. Visio is available for both Windows and Mac OS.
