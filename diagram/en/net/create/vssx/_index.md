 Generating VSSX file dynamically within running application is easy. In order to create VSSX documents from scratch without requiring MS Office, weâ€™ll use
 [Aspose.Diagram for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/diagram/net) 
 API that offers different features for visio creation, manipulation and conversion using .NET platform. Developers can easily enhance code for writing data, generating charts or graphs as well as creating table in spreadsheets.

Files with .VSSX extension are drawing stencils created with Microsoft Visio 2013 and above. The VSSX file format can be opened with Visio 2013 and above. Visio files are known for representation of a variety of drawing elements such as collection of shapes, connectors, flowcharts, network layout, UML diagrams, software diagrams, database models, objects mapping and other similar information. Microsoft Visio also provides the capability to convert Visio files to different file formats such as PNG, BMP, PDF and others. It is available for both Windows and Mac OS.
