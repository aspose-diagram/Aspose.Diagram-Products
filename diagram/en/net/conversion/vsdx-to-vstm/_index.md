 .NET developers can easily load & convert VSDX files to VSTM in just a few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

1.  Load VSDX file with an instance of Diagram class
1.  Call the Diagram.Save method with output file path and SaveFileFormat.VSTM as parameters
1.  VSTM file will be saved at the specified path

 A Diagram Management Library specially designed to work with Microsoft Visio files. It allows developers to create, manipulate & convert native Visio formats. Developers can create diagrams from scratch as well as easily load existing files and manipulate the elements of the diagram to export the result in other formats.

Files with .VSDX extension represent Microsoft Visio file format introduced from Microsoft Office 2013 onwards. It was developed to replace the binary file format, .VSD, which is supported by earlier versions of Microsoft Visio. It is also supported on Visio Services in Microsoft SharePoint Server 2013 and does not require an intermediary file format for publishing to SharePoint Server. Visio files are used to create drawings that contain visual objects, flow charts, UML diagram, information flow, organizational charts, software diagrams, network layout, database models, objects mapping and other similar information. Files generated using Visio can also be exported to different file formats such as PNG, BMP, PDF and others.

Files with VSTM extension are template files created with Microsoft Visio that support macros. Unlike VSDX files, files created from VSTM templates can run macros that are developed in Visual Basic for Applications (VBA)  code. A template file can be created in order to provide basic settings of the document that can be utilized to generate further documents with these settings. Visio files are used to create drawings that contain visual objects, flow charts, UML diagram, information flow, organizational charts, software diagrams, network layout, database models, objects mapping and other similar information. Files generated using Visio can also be exported to different file formats such as PNG, BMP, PDF and others.
