    {{% blocks/products/pf/agp/content h2="About Aspose.Diagram for .NET API" %}}

 Aspose.Diagram is a Microsoft Visio document format manipulation API. One can easily load, create, modify, manipulate including daigram elements and convert Visio diagrams to other formats such as PDF, XPS, JPEG, PNG, BMP, TIFF, SVG, EMF and more. It is a standalone API and does not require Microsoft Visio or any other software to be installed.

        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="VSDM" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/visio/vsdm/" >}}
Files with VSDM extension are drawing files created with Microsoft Visio application that supports macros. VSDM files are OPC/XML drawings that are similar to VSDX but also provide the capability to run macros when the file is opened. Macros are user defined actions/steps that are developed in Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) and can be used to perform repeatitive tasks. VSDM file format was introduced with the launch of Microsoft Visio 2013.  Visio files are used to create drawings that contain visual objects, flow charts, UML diagram, information flow, organizational charts, software diagrams, network layout, database models, objects mapping and other similar information. Files generated using Visio can also be exported to different file formats such as PNG, BMP, PDF and others.
