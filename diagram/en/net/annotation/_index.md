Managing Comments in Pages - There is not any limit that how many comments a page has in MS Visio. One can add as much as of application requirement. We will use the [Annotation Class](https://apireference.aspose.com/diagram/net/aspose.diagram/annotation) for all of this functionality.

+  Load Visio file using Diagram class object
+  Acess the relevant Page 
+  Call AddComment to add the comment
+  Use [Comment property](https://apireference.aspose.com/diagram/net/aspose.diagram/annotation/properties/comment) for adding comments content 
+  Save the diagram before & after calling AddComment method to compare
