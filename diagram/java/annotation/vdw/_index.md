 In order to annotate VDW file, weâ€™ll use
 [Aspose.Diagram for Java](https://products.aspose.com/diagram/java) 
 API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use merger API for Java platform. You can download its latest version directly from
 [Maven](https://repository.aspose.com/webapp/#/artifacts/browse/tree/General/repo/com/aspose/aspose-diagram) 
 and install it within your Maven-based project by adding the following configurations to the pom.xml.

 A basic document annotation and concatenating with
 [Aspose.Diagram for Java](https://products.aspose.com/diagram/java) 
 APIs can be done with just few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

+  Load VDW file by creating an instance of Diagram
+  Select Page via its id
+  Get annotation in Page's Pagesheet
+  Call the Remove() method to remove the comment
+  Call the Save() method and pass the file name (full path) and format (VSDX) as a parameter.
+  Now you can open and use the VSDX file in Microsoft Office, Adobe PDF or any other compatible program.

    {{% blocks/products/pf/agp/content h2="About Aspose.Diagram for Java API" %}}

 Aspose.Diagram is a Microsoft Visio document format manipulation API. One can easily load, create, modify, manipulate including daigram elements and convert Visio diagrams to other formats such as PDF, XPS, JPEG, PNG, BMP, TIFF, SVG, EMF and more. It is a standalone API and does not require Microsoft Visio or any other software to be installed.

        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="VDW" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/visio/vdw/" >}}
VDW is the Visio Graphics Service file format that specifies the streams and storages required for rendering a Web drawing. A web drawing is a collection of drawing pages, shapes, fonts, images, data connections, and diagram update information that can be rendered as a vector or raster drawing. VDW files can be opened in Microsoft Visio as well but are primarily saved for use on web. Microsoft Visio offers the capability to convert Visio files to a number of different file formats including PNG, BMP, PDF and others.
