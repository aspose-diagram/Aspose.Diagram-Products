 Aspose.Diagram is a Microsoft Visio document format manipulation API. One can easily load, create, modify, manipulate including daigram elements and convert Visio diagrams to other formats such as PDF, XPS, JPEG, PNG, BMP, TIFF, SVG, EMF and more. It is a standalone API and does not require Microsoft Visio or any other software to be installed. ‎

VSD files are drawings created with Microsoft Visio application to represent variety of graphical objects and the interconnection between these. Such drawings can contain visual objects such as visual objects, flow charts, UML diagram, information flow, organizational charts, software diagrams, network layout, database models, objects mapping and other similar information. Microsoft Visio offers the capability to convert Visio files to a number of different file formats including PNG, BMP, PDF and others.

        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="VSTM" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/image/vstm/" >}}

Files with VSTM extension are template files created with Microsoft Visio that support macros. Unlike VSDX files, files created from VSTM templates can run macros that are developed in Visual Basic for Applications (VBA)  code. A template file can be created in order to provide basic settings of the document that can be utilized to generate further documents with these settings. Visio files are used to create drawings that contain visual objects, flow charts, UML diagram, information flow, organizational charts, software diagrams, network layout, database models, objects mapping and other similar information. Files generated using Visio can also be exported to different file formats such as PNG, BMP, PDF and others.
