 Aspose.Diagram is a Microsoft Visio document format manipulation API. One can easily load, create, modify, manipulate including daigram elements and convert Visio diagrams to other formats such as PDF, XPS, JPEG, PNG, BMP, TIFF, SVG, EMF and more. It is a standalone API and does not require Microsoft Visio or any other software to be installed. ‎

Files with .VSSX extension are drawing stencils created with Microsoft Visio 2013 and above. The VSSX file format can be opened with Visio 2013 and above. Visio files are known for representation of a variety of drawing elements such as collection of shapes, connectors, flowcharts, network layout, UML diagrams, software diagrams, database models, objects mapping and other similar information. Microsoft Visio also provides the capability to convert Visio files to different file formats such as PNG, BMP, PDF and others. It is available for both Windows and Mac OS.

        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="VSDX" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/image/vsdx/" >}}

Files with .VSDX extension represent Microsoft Visio file format introduced from Microsoft Office 2013 onwards. It was developed to replace the binary file format, .VSD, which is supported by earlier versions of Microsoft Visio. It is also supported on Visio Services in Microsoft SharePoint Server 2013 and does not require an intermediary file format for publishing to SharePoint Server. Visio files are used to create drawings that contain visual objects, flow charts, UML diagram, information flow, organizational charts, software diagrams, network layout, database models, objects mapping and other similar information. Files generated using Visio can also be exported to different file formats such as PNG, BMP, PDF and others.
