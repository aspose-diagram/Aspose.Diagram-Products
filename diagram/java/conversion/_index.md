Programmers can easily convert VSDX, VSX, VTX, VDX, VSSX, VSTX, VSDM, VSSM, VSTM formats as well as loads VDW, VSD, VSS, VST and renders to PDF, HTML and Images. Considering the scenario of VSDX to VDX, process is, load the source VSDX file using diagram class and call the save method by providing output file and [SaveFileFormat](https://apireference.aspose.com/diagram/java/com.aspose.diagram/SaveFileFormat).VDX as parameters.

For generic conversion, process of converting visio files to images is same. Just load the file via Diagram class and call the save method with output file and SaveFileFormat output parameters. And whenever there is need to define specific options, developers can use ImageSaveOptions class while converting diagram pages to images and SVGSaveOptions for SVG conversion.
