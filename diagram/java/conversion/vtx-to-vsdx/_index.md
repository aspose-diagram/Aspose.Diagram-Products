 In order to render VTX to VSDX, we’ll use
 [Aspose.Diagram for Java](https://products.aspose.com/diagram/java) 
 API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use conversion API for Java platform. You can download its latest version directly from
 [Maven](https://repository.aspose.com/webapp/#/artifacts/browse/tree/General/repo/com/aspose/aspose-diagram) 
 and install it within your Maven-based project by adding the following configurations to the pom.xml.

 Java developers can easily convert VTX file to VSDX in just a few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

1.  Load VTX file with an instance of Diagram class
1.  Call Diagram.save method with output file path and SaveFileFormat as parameters
1.  VSDX file will be saved at the specified path

 Before running the Java conversion example code, make sure that you have the following prerequisites.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

- Microsoft Windows or a compatible OS with Java Runtime Environment for JSP/JSF Application and Desktop Applications.
- Get latest version of Aspose.Diagram for Java directly from Maven.

 Aspose.Diagram is a Microsoft Visio document format manipulation API. One can easily load, create, modify, manipulate including daigram elements and convert Visio diagrams to other formats such as PDF, XPS, JPEG, PNG, BMP, TIFF, SVG, EMF and more. It is a standalone API and does not require Microsoft Visio or any other software to be installed. ‎

        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="VTX" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/image/vtx/" >}}

A file with .vtx extension is a Microsoft Visio drawing template that is saved to disc in XML file format. The template is aimed to provide a file with basic settings that can be used to create multiple Visio files of the same settings. Another similar format is VST which is saved in binary format rather than XML. VTX files are supported with Visio 2010 and newer versions. Visio files are used to create drawings that contain visual objects, flow charts, UML diagram, information flow, organizational charts, software diagrams, network layout, database models, objects mapping and other similar information. Files generated using Visio can also be exported to different file formats such as PNG, BMP, PDF and others.

        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="VSDX" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/image/vsdx/" >}}

Files with .VSDX extension represent Microsoft Visio file format introduced from Microsoft Office 2013 onwards. It was developed to replace the binary file format, .VSD, which is supported by earlier versions of Microsoft Visio. It is also supported on Visio Services in Microsoft SharePoint Server 2013 and does not require an intermediary file format for publishing to SharePoint Server. Visio files are used to create drawings that contain visual objects, flow charts, UML diagram, information flow, organizational charts, software diagrams, network layout, database models, objects mapping and other similar information. Files generated using Visio can also be exported to different file formats such as PNG, BMP, PDF and others.
