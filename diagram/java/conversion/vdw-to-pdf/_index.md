 Aspose.Diagram is a Microsoft Visio document format manipulation API. One can easily load, create, modify, manipulate including daigram elements and convert Visio diagrams to other formats such as PDF, XPS, JPEG, PNG, BMP, TIFF, SVG, EMF and more. It is a standalone API and does not require Microsoft Visio or any other software to be installed. ‎

        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="VDW" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/web/vdw/" >}}

VDW is the Visio Graphics Service file format that specifies the streams and storages required for rendering a Web drawing. A web drawing is a collection of drawing pages, shapes, fonts, images, data connections, and diagram update information that can be rendered as a vector or raster drawing. VDW files can be opened in Microsoft Visio as well but are primarily saved for use on web. Microsoft Visio offers the capability to convert Visio files to a number of different file formats including PNG, BMP, PDF and others.

        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="PDF" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/view/pdf/" >}}

Portable Document Format (PDF) is a type of document created by Adobe back in 1990s. The purpose of this file format was to introduce a standard for representation of documents and other reference material in a format that is independent of application software, hardware as well as Operating System. PDF files can be opened in Adobe Acrobat Reader/Writer as well in most modern browsers like Chrome, Safari, Firefox via extensions/plug-ins. Most of the commercially available software suites also offer conversion of their documents to PDF file format without the requirement of any additional software component. Thus, PDF file format has full capability to contain information like text, images, hyperlinks, form-fields, rich media, digital signatures, attachments, metadata, Geospatial features and 3D objects in it that can become as part of source document.
